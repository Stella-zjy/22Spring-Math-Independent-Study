# 22Spring-Math-Independent-Study
 My Math Independent Study in Spring 2023. The study covers Diffusion-Reaction equation and its applications.
 This repository contains all the numerical simulations used for my project. I use Monte Carlo Simulation and Finite Difference Method to simulate Diffusion / Diffusion Reaction.
